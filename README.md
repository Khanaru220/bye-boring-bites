## README-driven development

### What I've expected to learn from this project?

1. Build my own things without tutorials (still refer tutorials for how-to knowledge)
2. deploy my app fast without complete all features (learn to how to isolate task)
3. Control more on OOS component library (try Kent's recommend)
4. TypeScript to React project
5. Manage states and do more with Redux (reduct toolkit, query)
6. Apply API's data to create more shiny, creative layout and useful design
7. Mock API to local (work offline + fast)
8. Apply search feature
9. Create comment feature like Twitter (authentication + serve data across accounts + database)
10. Make use more of hooks (useMemo, useCallback, my own custom hook)

### What I've not expected to learn?

1. Caching data
2. Fancy database - will use Firebase for backend
3. Testing - want to deploy my app ASAP
4. UX (feeling nice and easy to use/navigate) - want to focus on functionality (user can interact)
5. Github actions set up
6. Docker
7. NextJS - use pure React to understand its core and pain
8. Local text (in Vietnamese)
9. Adapt template structure, best practice - want to focus discorvering technology + service

### What's mission of this project?

- If I'm bored, what next thing/event I should do?
- My story: I want something to try, but don't know where/when, then I ask Bing's AI and findout some Hackathons to join and am also going to join others meetup + conference on EventBrite

### What things this project can do?

1. Core: When feel bored, user can click a button to generate random activites
2. Community: User can comments on activity as a guide, sharing
3. Search: user able to search with some indicators (location, environment, budget, accessibility)
   - (not core): user can pick on map to see recommend activities in that location (based on indicators, native recommend)
4. Profile: user able to save, take note
5. (not core) try to make it easiest to interact + fast (good UX) to live through boring mood
